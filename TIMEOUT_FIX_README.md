# Fix for Places Loading Timeout Issue

## Problem
The frontend was experiencing timeout errors (10 seconds) when trying to load places data. This was happening because:

1. The frontend was configured to use the production API URL (`https://oil-consumption-kg14.onrender.com`)
2. The production server might be down or slow to respond
3. No local backend server was running

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated API Configuration
- Modified `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to automatically use localhost:5000 in development mode
- Increased timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Added retry logic for timeout errors

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added loading states to the PlacesPage
- Added error display with retry functionality
- Improved user experience with better feedback

### 3. Environment-Based Configuration
- Frontend now automatically detects development vs production environment
- In development: uses `http://localhost:5000`
- In production: uses `https://oil-consumption-kg14.onrender.com`

## How to Use

### Option 1: Start Local Backend (Recommended)
1. Make sure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed
2. Configure your database connection in `backend/config/database.js`
3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   start-backend.bat
   
   # Or manually:
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Use Production Server
If you want to use the production server, make sure it's running and accessible.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Updated API configuration and timeout handling
- `frontend/src/pages/PlacesPage.tsx` - Added loading and error states
- `frontend/src/config/development.ts` - Created development configuration
- `start-backend.bat` - Created startup script for backend

## Testing
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Navigate to the Places page
4. You should see a loading spinner briefly, then the places data
5. If there's an error, you'll see an error message with a retry button

The timeout issue should now be resolved, and you'll have better error handling and user feedback.
